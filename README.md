Hi, my name is Augustin Ward, and I am a Computer Science and Engineering undergraduate at the University of Iowa with a strong foundation in C++, Python, and Java.

Through coursework and lab projects, I have developed skills in data structures, algorithm optimization, circuit design, and electronics.

My personal projects and extra learning have given me additional experience with C#, SQL, JavaScript, and HTML.

Additionally, I've collaborated with a John Deere engineer on a real-world engineering design project, where I gained experience in CAD modeling, prototyping, and testing as part of a structured development process.

I'm open to local or remote work and would love to hear back from you!
